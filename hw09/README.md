## Report my progress
- It would be useful to build my own R package to customize for more efficient work. 
- I've tried to make functions such as `square`, `cube`, `four`, and `reciprocal`. Those functions calculate square, cube, the fourth power, and reciprocal respectively, given a vector. They are able to print out a plot when the argument `plot_it` = TRUE (The default value is FALSE).
