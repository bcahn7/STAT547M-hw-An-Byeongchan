- `lengths()` can be used to get the length of each element of a list or atomic vector as an integer or numeric vector. This can be replaced by `map_int(.x, length)` in `purrr` library.

- `map2()` has TWO inputs. 
- There's no `map3()` However, we can use `pmap(.l, .f, ...)`. `.l` is a list of lists
